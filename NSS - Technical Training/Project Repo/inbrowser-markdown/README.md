This Markdown Editor is a web application that allows users to create, edit, and preview Markdown documents. It provides a user-friendly interface with features like document management, real-time preview, and a dark theme.

### The Requirements

-  View a full-page preview of the formatted content
-  View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
